% Question 2 (a)
% i. A has columns 1, 2, and 5, equal to columns 1,2, and 5, of B, respectively.
% i. Every other column of A is a linear combo of the other columns of A
% i. Thus, columns 3 and 4 are going to be linearly dependent, as they're linear combos of the other columns.
% i. Thus, by column correspondence, the rref(A) will have similar properties - 3 & 4 will be linear combos, but 1,2,&5 are linearly independent.
% ii. Since by column correspondence, the linear relationships between rows of a matrix and its rref are the same, we expect the ratios between columns of A and rref(A) to be the same.
% ii. Thus, since row 3 is 2*r1 + 3*r2 in A, we expect row 3 of rref(A) to be 2*r1 + 3*r2 of rref(A).
% ii. Similarly, we expect row 4 to be 4*r1 + (-5)*r2 of rref(A), similar to the relationship that row 4 exhibits in A.
